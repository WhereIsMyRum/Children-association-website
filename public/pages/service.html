                location, age and life circumstances. What is sponsorship? Find out more.</br></br>Here are some of the
                ways your support helps to reinforce healthy habits:</br></br>1. Sharing information (presentations,
                pamphlets, posters and one-on-one counseling) about critical health topics tailored to children or
                caregivers</br></br>2. Working to identify health-related attitudes and influence them with
                comprehensive communications</br></br>3. Creating learning opportunities where kids can practice skills
                in a supportive environment</br></br>4. Fostering individual support for kids and families with health
