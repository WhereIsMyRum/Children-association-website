    <ul>
        <li>Deliverable D0: the web application is accessible at <a href="/">this address</a>.</li>
        <li>Deliverable D2: the YAML or JSON file containing the specification
            of the app API can be found at <a href="/backend/specs.yaml">this address</a>.</li>
        <li>Deliverable D3: the SwaggerUI page of the same API is available at <a href="/backend/swaggerui">this
                address</a>.</li>
        <li>Deliverable D4: the source code of D0 is available as a zip file at
            <a href="/backend/app.zip">this address</a>.</li>
        <li>Deliverable D5: the address of the online source control repository
            is available <a href="https://github.com/piotrpolcikpolimi/hypermedia-app">this address</a>. We hereby
            declare that this is a private repository and, upon request, we will
            give access to the instructors.</li>

    <h2>Specification</h2>
    <h3>Web architecture</h3>
    <p>Describe here, with a diagram, the components of your web application
        and how they interact. Highlight which parts belong to the application
        layer, data layer or presentation layer. How did you ensure that HTML is
        not rendered server side?
    </p>
    <h3>API</h3>
    <h4>REST compliance</h4>
    <p>Describe here to what extent did you follow REST principles and what are
        the reasons for which you might have decided to diverge. Note, you must
        not describe the whole API here, just the design decisions.
    </p>
    <h4>OpenAPI Resource models</h4>
    <p>Describe here synthetically, which models you have introduced for
        resources.
    </p>
    <h3>Data model</h3>
    <p>Describe with an ER diagram the model used in the data layer of your web
        application. How these map to the OpenAPI data model?</p>
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <h3>Tools used</h3>
    <p>Describe here which tools, languages and frameworks did you use for the
        backend of the application.</p>
    <h3>Discussion</h3>
    <p>Describe here:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How did you make sure your web application adheres to the provided
            OpenAPI specification? Which method did you use to test all APIs
            endpoints against the expected response?</li>
        <p>answer</p>
        <li>Why do you think your web application adheres to common practices to
            partition a REST-based web application (static assets vs.
            application data)</li>
        <p>answer</p>
        <li>Describe synthetically why and how did you manage session state,
            what are the state change triggering actions (e.g., POST to login
            etc.).</li>
        <p>answer</p>
        <li>Which technology did you use (relational or a no-SQL database) for
            managing the data model?</li>
        <p>answer</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Other information</h2>
    <h3>Task assignment</h3>
    <p>Describe here how development tasks have been subdivided among members
        of the group.</p>
    <h3>Analysis of existing API</h3>
    <p>Describe here the research of (full or part of) existing APIs that are similar
        in objectives and scope to the one implemented, that have possibly guided
        implementation choices (these should not be necessarily OpenAPI
        implementations). Toy APIs (such as the Swagger's Pet Store) or the example
        shown during lectures are not a valid response.
    </p>
    <h3>Learning outcome</h3>
    <p>What was the most important thing all the members have learned while
        developing this part of the project, what questions remained unanswered,
        how you will use what you've learned in your everyday life?
