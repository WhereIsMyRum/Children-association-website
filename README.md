<h1 class="title">Children Association website</h1>
<h3 class="why">Why</h3>
  <p class="why">This is a final project for a subject <i>Hypermedia Applications</i> I took during my exchange period at the Politecnico di Milano in the year 2020. It involved not only coding the solution (both frontend and backend) but also various stages of UX and UI design, using a UX framework devised by the researchers at Politecnico di Milano.</p>
<h3 class="what">What</h3>
<p class="what">The Children Association website is a webpage of a fictional volountary association that focuses on helping underprivileged kids. All the content seen in the page is fictional or taken from other websites for non-commercial purposes (purely educational).</p>
<h3 class="how">How</h3>
<p class="how">The website and its content were first designed using Adobe XD and fore mentioned UX framework from Politecnico do Milano. This was done with the help of my peers. We were not allowed to use any of the available frontend frameworks nor templating systems, so I decided to create sort of a framework, or rather a templating system, of my own. In the framework every component that has dynamically loaded content is created in a separate file. It contains information regarding the html template it uses as well as how the data need to be pulled from the backend and inserted into the template accordingly. It's rather simple, but i consider it an interesting challenge and even though it slowed down the creation of the website at the beginning, at later stages it allowed the developement process to gain a lot of momentum and as a result it actually speeded up the process as a whole. The website is hosted on heroku, the developement process was done using Docker and NGINX. The backend was done using Swagger backend framework. The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database on heroku.</p>
<h3 class="usage">How to use</h3>
  <p class="usage">There's not much to using it, just go to the <a href="http://children-association.herokuapp.com/">Children association Website</a> and see for yourself!</p>
